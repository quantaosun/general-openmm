# Motivation

https://github.com/pablo-arantes has developed an excellent Colab workflow to run the simulation. This repo is designed for people who want to do a general molecular dynamic simulation locally using OpenMM with Amber inputs.

1. https://colab.research.google.com/github/pablo-arantes/Cloud-Bind/blob/main/GNINA.ipynb#scrollTo=wyzlRC-sBY3J to generate receptor.pdb and Docked1.pdb
2. https://github.com/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain to generate SYS_gaff2.prmtop and SYS_gaff2.crd
3. Download this repo to a local Linux with OpenMM installed, and run ```python prot_lig_openmm.py ```
